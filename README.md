# Matching VBF-quarks with jets

Welcome to my data analysis coding project done in summer 2021 at Cern CMS. 

This project is provides optimal matching between quarks and jets, using simulation data, and implementing this information to other research. Good overview of the project, and it's purpose, is explained at "Matching VBF-quarks with jet" pdf that can be found in folder "pdfs_and_pngs".

The coding project can be continued, for example focusing on the machine learning algorithms (using sklearn).

I recommend using Jupiter Notebook, SWAN (Cern) or other similar cell based coding environment that can hande .ipynb files. Good starting place (for a coder) is to open "main.ipynb", which has more information on the code. Of course the pdf "Matching VBF-quarks with jet" should be read carefully first.
